                "title": "C.1 BACKGROUND",
                "content": "The NBRC is a Federal-State partnership for economic and community development in Maine, pmNew Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. Each year, the NBRC provides Federal funds for critical economic and community development projects throughout the northeastern United States. The NBRC has grown rapidly over the past four Fiscal Years, from $20MM in appropriations in Fiscal Year (FY) 18 to over $60MM in FY 22, including partnership programs administered through collaborating agencies. Additionally, the NBRC was appropriated $150MM as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Legislation (BIL), to be deployed over the next five fiscal years. \nThe NBRC is seeking to migrate to a modern, secure SaaS GMS to not only facilitate compliance with government regulations and statutes, but to transform the way the agency executes its mission. The NBRC seeks a system that can serve as a portal for multiple grant application cycles / year and facilitate management and oversight of grant-funded projects, up to and including close-out activities. \nGiven the growth identified above, the NBRC anticipates receiving approximately 200 \u2013 400 project proposals per year, awarding up to 75-85 new awards per year, totaling approximately $50MM per year, at least through FY 28 (including both the IIJA funds referenced earlier, in addition to regular, annual appropriations). There are roughly 10 intake forms per project during the application process. The NBRC anticipates that approximately 12-15 staff, approximately 20-25 external reviewers, and up to 300 applicants and current grantees will need to use the new system annually. We anticipate these users would access the system through the established GUI created for the GMS. The NBRC thus seeks a grants management and reporting system that increases effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability and will allow automated processing and oversight of the grant\u2019s workflow for each of their programs. \nThe steps involved in the current approval/rejection process of a grant application are as follows: \n\u25cf \nApplications are reviewed for eligibility, if they are ineligible, they are marked as such and the applicant is informed. \n\u25cf \nIf the application is eligible it is marked as such then continues to a review process to determine its rank among the projects in each state. \n\u25cf \nAfter review and ranking it is voted on by the NBRC and if selected, awarded and turns into a grant through to completion and closeout. Emails generated during this process are NBRC staff-generated responses. \nThe new GMS SaaS will streamline and address gaps in business processes, grants management, financial interfaces [(the NBRC currently uses Pegasys Financial Services (PFS) as its Federal Shared Service Provider (FSSP)], and data management. \nThe new GMS SaaS will need to support the grant related business areas for the NBRC\u2019s three two major grant programs, with the ability to accommodate future programmatic growth. The NBRC defines a \"grant program\" as a publicly accessible opportunity to deploy Federal dollars consistent with the NBRC's statute, clustered around authorized areas of funding as specified in 40 U.S.C., Subtitle V. The NBRC currently offers two such programs; one larger program called Catalyst and one smaller program called Forest Economy Program (FEP). Both programs are similar with regard to application content and requirements (e.g., submission of Federal form SF424a), with differences primarily focused on categories of the economy that the grant dollars are intended to support (e.g., the \"forest products industry\"). While the NBRC cannot predict with 100% accuracy whether new programs will be added in future years -because Congress can appropriate funds for a specific program at any time -we do not anticipate more than two new programs being added in the next 2-3 years.",

No more than a total of two (2) relevant and recent project experiences provided in response to the solicitation may be from subcontractors.

Rather, only specific task orders issued under such vehicles should be submitted for evaluation. \nf. \nTechnical Assumptions (TAB F). The contractor shall identify and address any assumptions affecting the technical quote citing the component(s) of the quote to which they pertain. All technical assumptions and basis of estimate assumptions shall be included in the technical volume. This shall include any non-price information that serves as the basis of a price assumption identified in the contractor\u2019s price quote.

The offeror shall provide a demonstration of the proposed software, which shall be recorded and uploaded to YouTube.com via the link provided in Tab G.

Following the demonstration of the software, the Government may -but is not required to-submit written questions to the offeror, as deemed prudent, to clarify the offeror\u2019s proposed capabilities, methodologies, and approaches. The Government intends to ask clarifying questions as may be useful for the evaluators to sufficiently understand what is being proposed. \nThe offeror shall restrict the privacy settings for the demonstration video at YouTube.com. The privacy setting shall be Private (not Public or Unlisted) with access provided only to the Contracting Officer and the Contract Specialist (email addresses listed in Section L.5 above). It is the responsibility of the offeror to ensure the privacy of the video. The Government may request that the contractor add additional email addresses after the solicitation closes.
